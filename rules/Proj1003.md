# Proj1003: Use Sonar analyzers
[SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com/) has implemented multiple generic
Roslyn static code analysis rules both for C# and Visual Basic. These Roslyn
analyzers allow you to produce safe, reliable and maintainable code by helping
you find and correct bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your codebase.
It is strongly advised to enable this rules on all your projects.

See: https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet

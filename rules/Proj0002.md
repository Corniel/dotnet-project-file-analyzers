# Proj0002: Upgrade legacy .NET project file
In 2017, Microsoft introduced a new project file structure for .NET. The
previous format dated back to 2023, when .NET 1.0 was released.

The new (well, not anymore) format is way less verbose, and the old format
does not support .NET core/standard or .NET 5.0+.

Note that all rules of `DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers` do not support the legacy
project format. So also from that perspective, it is better to update.
